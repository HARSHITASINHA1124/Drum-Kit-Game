# 🥁 Drum Kit Web App

Welcome to the **Drum Kit Web App**!
Built with ❤️ using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this is a fun little interactive project where you can play drum sounds either by clicking the buttons or pressing specific keys on your keyboard.

---

## 🎯 Features

* Click buttons or press keys (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `J`, `K`, `L`) to play drum sounds
* Responsive and colorful UI
* Keyboard and mouse support
* Simple animation effect on button press

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Each drum button is linked to a specific sound file and key:

| Key/Button | Sound        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| W          | Tom 1        |
| A          | Tom 2        |
| S          | Tom 3        |
| D          | Tom 4        |
| J          | Snare        |
| K          | Crash Cymbal |
| L          | Kick Bass    |

When a user interacts with any button (click or keypress), a corresponding sound plays and a brief animation highlights the button.
